## Future work ##
Some of the features we plan to add in the next versions are:
  * Bi-plane approach for 3D imaging
  * Enhanced load balancing for improved performance of parallel processing
  * A new module for crowded-field data analysis
  * Improved artificial data generator
  * Tools for additional data analysis, e.g., clustering and co-localization
